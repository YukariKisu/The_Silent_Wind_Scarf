🌬 The Silent Wind 
---

 Wind is invisible, yet always present. Sometimes it lashes out as a storm; other times, it wraps around us as a gentle breeze.

---
💡Purpose
--

Wind is the invisible, but it clearly touches our bodies. To enable us to feel the invisible, this project uses light and motion as alternative expressions.

---

🎨 Concept
--

“Giving shape to the invisible” — transforming the unseen into something we can feel, through technology and the sensibility of Japanese culture.
